                        <p>Naturally strong female characters, amazing arcs and layered personalities, fascinating plots. I just can't talk enough about how much I enjoy this show! We could definitely have an <em>endless Star Trek-like</em> The Expanse: it only gets better at every season.</p>
                        <p>Trying really hard not to spoil anything here but things got HOT in the last season! <strong>Unpopular opinion</strong>: Marco Inaros had a point, although I condemn basically all of his actions at the same time. And because of these mixed feelings (and for many other reasons) I'm both excited and sad that The Expanse will have a 6th season next year.</p>

                        <p>So while I wait for Season 6 to release (as I don't think I'll have time to read the books anytime soon) what's left for me is to rewatch the series so I can hear (and cry) to Ashford's song once again,and enjoy

                    <h3>DOWN WITH BRIGADEIRO!</h3>
                    <p>It's true that our beloved <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigadeiro" target="_blank">Brigadeiro</a> is the most popular brazilian dessert.</p>
                    <p>But as a Brazilian, I just can't agree with it's popularity when we can do so much better.</p>
                    <p>Today I'm going to show you an underrated dessert that is not only Brazilian <em>(ok, one might say that the Portuguese invented it, but we just improved the Quindim by replacing expensive almonds with coconut. Fair enough!)</em> but is also <strong>better than Brigadeiro!</strong></p>
                    <p>Behold... <strong>The Quindim!</strong></p>

                    <p>The recipe is quite simple, you'll just need a lot of egg yolks.</p>

                    <p><strong>INGREDIENTS:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>15 egg yolks</li>
                            <li>1 ½ cup sugar</li>
                            <li>3 tablespoons butter (melted)</li>
                            <li>100g coconut</li>
                            <li>pinch of salt</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p><strong>PREPARE:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F and grease a muffin tin; </li>
                        <li>Stir together sugar, coconut, melted butter, and salt in a medium bowl. Gradually add egg
                            yolks, stirring well after each addition;</li>
                        <li>Fill the muffin tin with coconut in the bottom, then stir in the mix from step 2;</li>
                        <li>In a large roasting pan, add hot water and place the muffin tin with the quindim mix,
                            carefully;</li>
                        <li>Bake for 40 minutes;</li>
                        <li>Carefully remove if from the oven and serve at room temperature, or cool the quindins in the
                            fridge.</li>
                    </ol>
